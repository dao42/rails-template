1. `dao42/rails-template` keep the newest easily because it's a real `Rails Application Template`.
2. `dao42/rails-template` love the newest standard components of Rails 6, using `webpacker` and remove `assets pipeline`.

4. `dao42/rails-template` is out-of-box for your deployment based on `mina`.

## How to use

Install dependencies:

* postgresql

    ```bash
    $ brew install postgresql
    ```

    Ensure you have already initialized a user with username: `postgres` and password: `postgres`( e.g. using `$ createuser -d postgres` command creating one )

* rails 6

    Using `rbenv`, update `ruby` up to 2.5 or higher, and install `rails 6.0.0`

    ```bash
    $ ruby -v ( output should be 2.5.x or 2.6.x )

    $ gem sources --add https://gems.ruby-china.com/ --remove https://rubygems.com/` (optional, Chinese developer recommend)

    $ gem install rails

    $ rails -v ( output should be rails 6.0.0 )
    ```

* yarn

    Install `npm`, `yarn` for webpacker( see install document: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

    ```bash
    $ yarn --version( output should be 1.6.x or higher )

    $ npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org (optional, Chinese developer recommend)
    ```

Then,

1. Add `gems.ruby-china.com` to your bundle mirrors (optional, Chinese developer recommended)

    `$ bundle config mirror.https://rubygems.org https://gems.ruby-china.com`

2. Create your own rails app applying `rails-template`

    `$ rails new myapp --skip-sprockets -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dao42/rails-template/master/composer.rb`

    Important!! replace `myapp` to your real project name, we will generate lots of example files by this name.

3. Done! Trying to start it.
